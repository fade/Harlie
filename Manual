Operator's Manual

1. Initializing the database

You'll need to install PostgreSQL and create a database instance for the bot.

  $ createdb botdb

The file schema.sql contains the bare minimum database schema for the bot.
You'll need to pipe it to psql, but you'll also need to specify ownership for
tables and so forth.

  $ sed 's/#laughingboy#/BOT-OWNER/g' < schema.sql | psql botdb

where BOT-OWNER should be the name of the PostgreSQL user who 'owns' the bot db.
(Usually also the Linux username which starts the bot processes.)

2. Adding a new channel

The bot gets its information on how to start up instances from two
places: from the config.lisp source file, and also from the database.

First, edit config.lisp to add a new instance there.  There should be
one defparameter form calling make-config to define all the bot
instances.  Each new nick should be added as a form within
irc-nickchannels, and a new web-server-port should be added to
web-server-ports.

But this doesn't tell the bot which web server port should be
associated with which nickname, and it also doesn't create a context.
Contexts are stored in the database's contexts table:

botdb=# select * from contexts;
 context_id | context_name | irc_server  | irc_channel |     web_server     | web_port | web_uri_prefix 
------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+--------------------+----------+----------------
          3 | shogun       | irc.srh.org | #walled     | 127.0.0.1          |     9099 | /
          4 | thugster     | irc.srh.org | #wallednoc  | 127.0.0.1          |     7080 | /
          2 | SR-4         | irc.srh.org | #fanoogle   | localhost          |     5801 | /
          6 | Shrtmegister | irc.srh.org | #blowme     | blowme.deepsky.com |     6969 | /
          1 | harlot       | irc.srh.org | #trinity    | 10.0.1.3           |     5791 | /
(5 rows)

When adding a new nickname, you'll also need to add an entry to this
table.

Access the database ("psql botdb") and enter a command of the
following form:

botdb=# INSERT INTO contexts (context_name, irc_server, irc_channel,
web_server, web_port, web_uri_prefix) VALUES ('newbotnick',
'irc.srh.org', '#channelname', 'coruscant.deepsky.com', 8188, '/');

NOTA BENE: The web_port value is an *integer*, not a string.  All the
other values are strings.

Once you've edited config.lisp and added the row to the contexts
table, you should restart the bot.  There is as yet no good way to add
a bot instance on the fly.
