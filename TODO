- add config option for non-babbling bot instances
- paste bin
- user profiles/auth
  - two levels: easy, depending on host/ident, and hard, using dcc/https
- shore up config, context, db schemas, db initialization
  - contexts finer-grained than per-nick
  - many-to-one IRC:Web context mappings?
  - migrate DB credentials out of context system?
- enable plugins selectively on a contextual basis
- create a REPL context for testing
  - also make it easier to run other contexts from the REPL
- Pre-reserve short URL hashes corresponding to Web service names
- Starting an instance with an empty DB should just work.
- Harden the /source service against fetching forbidden or nonexistent files.

BUG: Why does the en dash in the title of http://www.vulva-original.com/home-en.htm
not get correctly decoded from UTF-8?

- Logarithmic probabilities in chainer
- Coalesce entries in chain DB
- Add smarter indexing for URLs
- Make the context subsystem (and other parts, generally)
  recover more gracefully when errors attack
  - In particular, if there are no contexts, no words
    in context, or no urls in context, a report would
    be in order, not a freeze.
- Support for following nick changes
- Event logging
- Do full RFC 2616 comparisons of URLs in the shortener
  - scheme name, host name are case-insensitive
  - empty path == "/"
  - do lookups on raw IP addrs?
- Count plugin usage to see what's popular?

- Calendars, reminders within the bot
  - Hook into Google Calendar/iCal/other services for same

Major Refactoring for Contexts/Multiheaded [Tuxedo]

There's still some ugly bodgery in the mapping from Web server
ports to contexts.  Build support to incorporate Web server
names, names/IPs, base URIs, etc.

Also, get the bots to get more of their configuration out of
the database rather than half from the config file.

- Get full host string w/Web request
- Smart rejoin

- !conv: detect failed return?
- Limit length of title strings
- Paginate full-page URL listing
- Get redirected URIs [DONE]
- Smarter chaining: punctuation, better endings

- Do some unit conversion locally
- Test that short URLs won't collide
- Implement transactions in DB
- Read Web pages for chaining data
- Shorter domain name w/out port #
  - Now that we're in production, maybe this takes a back seat.

- Make short URLs longer when table > high water mark
- Auth module
- Twitter plug-in, SMS gateway
- More back-end Web stuff

BUGS

- The timers are still wedging.

- Rebuild the triggerlist stuff to always attempt to refill to the low water mark

- Drakma needs an option to avoid URL-encoding the URL
  - We have a fix in our tree
  - The RFCs support Drakma's interpretation
  - They may not accept our patch.

- !conv fails on weird utf-8 inputs [Found by Kritter]
- Should https:// links be shortened? [Found by Kritter, Fade]
- http://www.phat.uklinux.net/cgi-bin/crash.cgi doesn't generate a return [Found by Kritter]

Issues
  irc-client.lisp:start-ignoring
   - Replace the test somehow and push with pushnew?

  Why's the assignment to clhs-lookup::*hyperspec-root* in fetch-file not always going
  through as it should?

 Every use of flexi-streams is going to need wrapped with that *substitution-char* bullshit.

 Apparently the METAR data handed out by NOAA is garbage.
